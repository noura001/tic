            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Amid rapid technological changes and international transformations, the educational system faces a challenge regarding the need to provide additional learning opportunities. Therefore, many educational institutions have begun addressing this challenge by developing distance education programs. Distance education is initially conducted using audio and video technology, information and communication technologies, and printed materials.
                Information and Communications Technology (TIC) can be defined as a comprehensive system that encompasses all means, tools, and systems based on modern technology to facilitate the collection, processing, storage, transfer, and retrieval of data, aiming to improve human communication and productivity across various economic, social, educational, and cultural sectors. This field includes a diverse mix of technologies that integrate computing, networking, wired and wireless communications, devices, software, and digital services. The term TIC, which emerged in the 1980s and gained popularity in 1997, is considered a broader equivalent to Information Technology (TI) since TIC ICT emphasizes unified communications and the integration of communications for storing and transmitting information. [1]
                TIC is defined as the backbone of the modern information age and is considered a fundamental factor in promoting innovation, developing businesses, and improving efficiency across all economic and social sectors.

        <section id="Git and GitHub" class="section">
            <h2>Git and GitHub </h2>
            <p>GitHub is a leading platform for managing software development projects and hosting code repositories using Git, a widely adopted version control system. Launched in 2008, GitHub has transformed the way developers collaborate by providing a streamlined interface and advanced tools. With its robust capabilities, it caters to both open-source communities and private development teams, fostering innovation and productivity.</p>
            <h3>1-How GitHub Works:</h3>
            <p>GitHub operates on Git, an open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for managing the Linux kernel's development. Git allows developers to track changes to files, maintain a detailed history of modifications, and experiment with new features through branching. This branching model ensures that changes can be tested independently before merging them into the main codebase.
                Developers work locally using Git to create and modify repositories, enabling offline productivity. Once updates are finalized, they are pushed to remote repositories hosted on GitHub, ensuring team-wide access and collaboration. GitHub enhances this process with features such as Pull Requests, which facilitate code review and approval workflows.
                Repositories on GitHub are organized databases that store project files and their version history. They can be public for open-source collaboration or private for restricted access. Advanced tools like Issues, project boards, and GitHub Actions automate workflows, making project management seamless and efficient.
                </p>
            <h3>2-Key Features of GitHub:</h3>
            <li>1.	Issue Tracking and Collaboration: GitHub provides integrated tools for reporting bugs, tracking tasks, and discussing enhancements.</li>
            <li>2.	Pull Requests: These allow developers to propose changes, facilitate peer reviews, and ensure high-quality code merges.</li>
            <li>3.	Workflow Automation: GitHub Actions enables automated testing, deployment, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.</li>
            <li>4.	Social Features: With comments, reactions, and contributions tracking, GitHub fosters an interactive development environment.</li>
            <li>5.	GitHub Pages: Developers can deploy static websites directly from repositories, simplifying web hosting for personal or project-related content.</li>
            <h3>3-The Role of Git and GitHub in Modern Software Development:</h3>
            <p>Git and GitHub have redefined the development lifecycle by facilitating version control and collaboration. Git's decentralized model allows team members to work independently on their local branches, minimizing conflicts and ensuring streamlined integration. By maintaining a comprehensive history of changes, Git makes debugging and auditing efficient.
                GitHub enhances these advantages by centralizing collaboration and project management. Features like project boards and milestone tracking ensure clear workflows, while the platform's extensive community fosters knowledge sharing. Open-source projects hosted on GitHub attract contributions from around the globe, accelerating innovation and quality improvement.
